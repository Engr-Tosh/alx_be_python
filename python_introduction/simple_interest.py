#applying basic python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate simple interest

#declare the variables for principal, time and interest rate.

principal = 1000
rate = 0.05

time = 3

#calculate simple interest using formula I=PRT
interest = principal * rate * time

print ('The simple interest is:', interest)
