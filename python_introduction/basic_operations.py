#To practice baxic arithmetic operations in python by performing predefined calculations

#declare two variables each to hold an integer number
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

#Declare variables to store the sum, diff and product of the numbers
sum = number1 + number2
diff = number1 - number2
product = number1 * number2

#output the answers to user
print ("Addition of", number1, "and", number2, "is", sum)
print ("Substraction of", number2, "and", number1, "is", diff)
print ("Multiplication of", number1, "and", number2, "is", product)
